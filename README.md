## Problem

Given an integer n, return a counter function. This counter function initially returns n and then returns 1 more than the previous value every subsequent time it is called (n, n + 1, n + 2, etc).
 

Example 1:
```cpp
Input: 
n = 10 
["call","call","call"]
Output: [10,11,12]
Explanation: 
counter() = 10 // The first time counter() is called, it returns n.
counter() = 11 // Returns 1 more than the previous time.
counter() = 12 // Returns 1 more than the previous time.
```
The function returned by createHelloWorld should always return "Hello World".`

Example 2:
```cpp
Input: 
n = -2
["call","call","call","call","call"]
Output: [-2,-1,0,1,2]
Explanation: counter() initially returns -2. Then increases after each sebsequent call.
```
Any arguments could be passed to the function but it should still always return "Hello World".
 

Constraints:
`-1000 <= n <= 1000
0 <= calls.length <= 1000
calls[i] === "call"`
